== README

This is code from the React.js - A guide for Rails developers article on https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers

Things I changed

* Converted records.js.coffeescript to records.js

I'm not a fan of Coffeescript, I will likely convert all of it to JS, and maybe JSX.
